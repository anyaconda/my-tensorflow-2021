    "The Civil Comments dataset comprises approximately 2 million public comments that were submitted to the Civil Comments platform. [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/) sponsored the effort to compile and annotate these comments for ongoing [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04561); they've also hosted competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) to help classify toxic comments as well as minimize unintended model bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Civil Comments data, a subset of comments are tagged with a variety of identity attributes pertaining to gender, sexual orientation, religion, race, and ethnicity. Each identity annotation column contains a value that represents the percentage of annotators who categorized a comment as containing references to that identity. Multiple identities may be present in a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** These identity attributes are intended *for evaluation purposes only*, to assess how well a classifier trained solely on the comment text performs on different tag sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect these identity labels, each comment was reviewed by up to 10 annotators, who were asked to indicate all identities that were mentioned in the comment. For example, annotators were posed the question: \"What genders are mentioned in the comment?\", and asked to choose all of the following categories that were applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Male\n",
    "* Female\n",
    "* Transgender\n",
    "* Other gender\n",
    "* No gender mentioned\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** *We recognize the limitations of the categories used in the original dataset, and acknowledge that these terms do not encompass the full range of vocabulary used in describing gender.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate score for each identity attribute representing the percentage of raters who said the identity was mentioned in the comment. For example, if 10 annotators reviewed a comment, and 6 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"female\" and 0 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"male,\" the comment would receive a `female` score of `0.6` and a `male` score of `0.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For the purposes of annotation, a comment was considered to \"mention\" gender if it contained a comment about gender issues (e.g., a discussion about feminism, wage gap between men and women, transgender rights, etc.), gendered language, or gendered insults. Use of \"he,\" \"she,\" or gendered names (e.g., Donald, Margaret) did not require a gender label. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Label\n",
    "\n",
    "Each comment was rated by up to 10 annotators for toxicity, who each classified it with one of the following ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very Toxic\n",
    "* Toxic\n",
    "* Hard to Say\n",
    "* Not Toxic\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate toxicity \"score\" for each comment (ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`) to serve as the [label](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary?utm_source=Colab&utm_medium=fi-colab&utm_campaign=fi-practicum&utm_content=glossary&utm_term=label#label), representing the fraction of annotators who labeled the comment either \"Very Toxic\" or \"Toxic.\" For example, if 10 annotators rated a comment, and 3 of them labeled it \"Very Toxic\" and 5 of them labeled it \"Toxic\", the comment would receive a toxicity score of `0.8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For more information on the Civil Comments labeling schema, see the [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) section of the Jigsaw Untended Bias in Toxicity Classification Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing the data\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, we converted toxicity and identity columns to booleans in order to work with our neural net and metrics calculations. In the preprocessed dataset, we considered any value ≥ 0.5 as True (i.e., a comment is considered toxic if 50% or more crowd raters labeled it as toxic).\n",
    "\n",
    "For identity labels, the threshold 0.5 was chosen and the identities were grouped together by their categories. For example, if one comment has `{ male: 0.3, female: 1.0, transgender: 0.0, heterosexual: 0.8, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian: 1.0 }`, after processing, the data will be `{ gender: [female], sexual_orientation: [heterosexual, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian] }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Missing identity fields were converted to False.\n"

In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.\"\n",

As a society we appear to be attempting to sanitize our language and are even prepared to jail offenders who do not adhere to what the police of political correctness mandate as acceptable or not acceptable. Allegedly, we are doing this as a society because of what those symbols or historical persons or entities or hurtful language represent to some members of our society.

I started the ADA diet and followed it 100% for a few weeks and could not get my blood sugar to go below 140. Finally i began to panic and called my doctor, he told me to get used to it. He said I would be on metformin my whole life and eventually insulin. At that point i knew something wasn\\'t right and began to do a lot of research. Then I found Lisa\\342\\200\\231s diabetes story (google \\\" HOW EVER I FREED MYSELF FROM THE DIABETES \\\" ) I read that article from end to end because everything the writer was saying made absolute sense. I started the diet that day and the next morning my blood sugar was down to 100 and now i have a fasting blood sugar between Mid 70\\'s and the 80\\'s. My doctor took me off the metformin after just three week of being on this lifestyle change. I have lost over 30 pounds and 6+ inches around my waist in a month. The truth is we can get off the drugs and help myself by trying natural methods\"\n",

Our news outlets suffer a painful withholding of advertising any time they tell. According to ConocoPhillips\\' unaudited report. Alaska\\'s producers were netting $17 per barrel from last quarter\\'s Alaska production. I doubt that the big three can point to a single other country that lets them keep more than $5 per barrel. Alaska\\'s big three do happily produce in exchange for an average of a $1 profit in several countries. Last quarter Alaska produce about 46 million barrels. Had we kept $12 of the $17 and let them keep $5, they would have cried all the way to the bank, and continued producing. Alaska would have received an additional $550 million. Four quarters of the same would add up to $2.2 Billion. Passing an income tax will take the pressure off of our oil company owned legislature to get your rightful share of profits from our state owned oil.\"\n",
